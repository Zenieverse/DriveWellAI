# DriveWellAI
DriveWell AI — Smart Driver Wellness Guardian. DriveWell AI detects driver fatigue, stress, and distraction in real time using cabin vision, steering patterns, and wearables — ensuring safer, smarter journeys.”



🧠 Problem
Driver fatigue and stress account for a large percentage of accidents, especially in long-haul and fleet operations. Current systems either rely on manual reporting or expensive vehicle integrations.
💡 Solution
DriveWell AI provides an edge-AI-powered mobile app that connects to cabin video feeds, steering sensors, and wearables to monitor driver alertness, stress, and wellness. It delivers non-distracting alerts and personalized recovery suggestions — all without constant cloud connectivity.
⚙️ Core Features
1. AI Cabin Vision Module
Accesses the phone’s front camera or an in-cabin dashcam.
Runs on-device face landmark detection (eyes, blink rate, yawning, head pose).
Detects signs of drowsiness, micro-sleep, and distraction.
2. Steering Behavior Analytics
Connects to car telematics (via OBD-II Bluetooth dongle) or steering angle sensors.
Analyzes steering correction frequency, lane deviation, and sudden swerves.
3. Wearable Data Integration
Optional Bluetooth pairing with smartwatches (Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin).
Reads heart rate variability (HRV), skin temperature, motion levels.
Detects stress spikes and correlates with road events.
4. AI Decision Engine (Edge)
Combines multi-sensor inputs into a driver wellness score (0–100).
Classifies states: Focused, Mild Fatigue, Severe Fatigue, Stress Alert.
5. Real-time Feedback
Voice-based or haptic alerts (“Take a short break”, “Consider hydration”).
Suggests AI-personalized interventions like breathing guidance or quick stops nearby.
6. Fleet Dashboard (Web Companion)
Fleet managers can see aggregated driver wellness trends (optional privacy consent).
Predictive alerts before fatigue-related incidents occur.
7. Privacy & Ethics
All video and biometric processing happens locally on device (Edge AI).
No personal data leaves the vehicle unless explicitly shared.
